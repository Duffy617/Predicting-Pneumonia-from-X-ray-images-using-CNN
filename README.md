## 【**Predicting-Pneumonia-from-X-ray-images-using-CNN**】

This projects intends to analyze and create a model on the Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset to predict if a particular observation is at a risk of developing Pneumonia.<br />

The dataset can be found on the Kaggle website. The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal). Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou. <br />
